Format your answers in a Jupyter notebook. To receive full credit, make sure you address every part of the problem, and make sure your document is formatted in a clean and professional way.\n\nIn this lab, you will be working with the [2017 Workplace Health in America survey](https://www.cdc.gov/workplacehealthpromotion/survey/data.html) which was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the survey's [guidence document](https://www.cdc.gov/workplacehealthpromotion/data-surveillance/docs/2017-WHA-Guidance-Document-for-Use-of-Public-Data-files-508.pdf):\n\n> The Workplace Health in America (WHA) Survey gathered information from a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of US worksites. The sample was drawn from the Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) database of all private and public employers in the United States with at least 10 employees. Like previous national surveys, the worksite served as the sampling unit rather than the companies or firms to which the worksites belonged. Worksites were selected using a stratified simple random sample (SRS) design, where the primary strata were ten multi-state regions defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), plus an additional stratum containing all hospital worksites. \n\nThe data contain over 300 features that report the industry and type of company where the respondents are employed, what kind of health insurance and other health programs are offered, and other characteristics of the workplaces including whether employees are allowed to work from home and the gender and age makeup of the workforce. The data are full of interesting information, but in order to make use of the data a great deal of data manipulation is required first.","metadata":{"cell_id":"00000-4c736030-a116-4de8-9ba7-749578e46450","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Problem 0\nImport the following libraries:","metadata":{"cell_id":"00001-d6d04147-2ff1-4bdc-8a0b-f2358a8add18","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00002-729b43cf-84e6-45ce-8b2e-a958a7e323e7","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"9d73b2f2","execution_millis":1390,"execution_start":1603495741960},"source":"!pip install sidetable==0.7.0\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport sidetable\nimport sqlite3\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nimport urllib\n\n#pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 10) #display a maximumn of 10 rows\n#pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Requirement already satisfied: sidetable==0.7.0 in /opt/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages (0.7.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: pandas>=1.0 in /opt/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from sidetable==0.7.0) (1.0.5)\nRequirement already satisfied: pytz>=2017.2 in /opt/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from pandas>=1.0->sidetable==0.7.0) (2020.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.13.3 in /opt/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from pandas>=1.0->sidetable==0.7.0) (1.19.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.6.1 in /opt/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from pandas>=1.0->sidetable==0.7.0) (2.8.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: six>=1.5 in /opt/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from python-dateutil>=2.6.1->pandas>=1.0->sidetable==0.7.0) (1.15.0)\n\u001b[33mWARNING: You are using pip version 20.2.3; however, version 20.2.4 is available.\nYou should consider upgrading via the '/opt/venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.\u001b[0m\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Problem 1\nThe raw data are stored in an ASCII file on the 2017 Workplace Health in America survey [homepage](https://www.cdc.gov/workplacehealthpromotion/survey/data.html).
